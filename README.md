Exploratory Data Analysis of the Adult Income dataset using Python

Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Adult Income dataset, focusing on how demographic, educational, and occupational factors relate to income levels. The objective is to demonstrate data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insight generation using Python.
The dataset is commonly used for socio-economic analysis and is well suited for demonstrating analytical thinking and practical data skills.

Objectives
Explore demographic and employment characteristics of individuals
Analyze the relationship between education, age, occupation, and income
Identify patterns related to income inequality
Demonstrate data cleaning and preprocessing best practices
Communicate insights using visualizations and summary statistics

Dataset Description
The dataset includes individual-level information such as:
Demographics: age, sex, race, marital status, relationship
Education: education level, education number
Employment: workclass, occupation
Financial indicator: income category (≤50K or >50K)

Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following steps were performed:
Removed duplicate records
Replaced "?" values with NA
Standardized column names
Created derived features such as age groups for analysis
These steps ensured the dataset was consistent and suitable for statistical analysis.

Key Analyses Performed
Age and education distribution analysis
Education level comparison across gender and race
Occupation and workclass distribution
Income distribution by education and occupation
Gender-based income disparity analysis
Correlation analysis between age and education level

Key Insights
Most individuals earn ≤ $50K, with a smaller proportion earning > $50K
Higher education levels (Bachelors and above) are strongly associated with higher income
Executive and professional roles dominate among high-income earners
Males are overrepresented in higher-paying occupations
Education level shows only a weak correlation with age, indicating access and opportunity play a larger role

Tools & Technologies
Python 
Pandas 
NumPy 
Matplotlib 
Seaborn 
Jupyter Notebook

Why This Project Matters
This analysis demonstrates:
Practical data cleaning skills
Exploratory data analysis techniques
Ability to derive socio-economic insights from real-world data
Clear communication of analytical findings
The skills applied here are transferable to domains such as development analytics, labor market analysis, and policy research.
